# Smart MCQ Assessment System

## Project Description
The Smart MCQ Assessment System uses a Linear Regression model to predict user performance levels. Based on the student's performance, students are divided into six stages, each with different levels of questions. We developed this project using Python and Flask. The quiz is timed for 2 minutes (this duration can be changed). 

To predict student performance, we use a dataset containing the following attributes:
- Hours Studied
- Previous Scores
- Extracurricular Activities
- Sleep Hours
- Sample Question Papers Practiced
- Performance Index

Using this dataset, we create a model to predict the performance index. In the system, we gather user inputs for Hours Studied, Previous Scores, Extracurricular Activities, Sleep Hours, and Sample Question Papers Practiced, and then predict their performance index.

## Installation Instructions
1. Create a database named `tcc1_database`.
2. Use the provided SQL code in the repository to set up the database.
3. Run the `app.py` file to start the application.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Flask
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- MySQL DB

## Features
- Students can take exams based on their performance level.
